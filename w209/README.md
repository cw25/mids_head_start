## Data Visualization and Communication

This course aims to teach the fundamentals of communicating data and analysis to people of different backgrounds. 

In academia, you present to people who want to criticize your work to make sure it stands up to the standards of scientific research and sound logic. In professional environments, you present to people who want to use your work to make more money by increasing revenue or decreasing costs. In data science conferences or meetups, you present to people who want to learn how to work smarter and find out cool things other people do. Each of these groups loves data visualization, but they all prefer different takes. 

Academics prefer statistical plots that provide a lot of information without a lot of wasted ink. Business people love pie charts because they don't take up a lot of space and can have pretty colors. Data science fellows love interactive charts that they can explore and try to learn more about the udnerlying relationships without having to endlessly peer at numbers.

Understaning your audience and catering to them can hurt, especially when they want to see pie charts. Sometimes it makes sense to present information in a different way than expected, but sometimes that causes misunderstanding due to learning curve involved with change. The best and only way to truly learn great data visualization skills? Practice. Create charts on a lot of different data sources and create different charts for the same data source. Practicing creating charts helps you build intuition on what looks good, what can be quickly digested and what takes more time to create than the value it provides.
