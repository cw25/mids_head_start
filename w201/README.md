## What is Data Science?

RDADA aims to help incoming students from all sorts of backgrounds get on the same page about what it means to study and practice data science. To understand what to learn, you need to know how we got to this situation, what types of roles exist and what the future might have in store. 

RDADA covers a lot of broad topics regarding communicating and interpreting information. Examples include dealing with high stakes situations, explaining technical information to different audiences and considering cognitive biases and the concepts in behavior economics.

Due to the diversity of MIDS students, no single path to success in RDADA truly exists. Instead, read as much as you can about the field, both technical and 'soft' articles. You'll eventually find that a big part of successful data science projects involve basic considerations of human thinking, like how to actually motivate people to take your recommendation or how to convince someone that the data available isn't sufficient to accomplish a particular analysis. 

Here are some suggested readings, both from class and otherwise. Links are broken down in roughly 3 topics: mathy stuff; computery stuff; humany stuff.
