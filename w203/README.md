## Exploring and Analyzing Data

Also known as *Introduction to Statistics with R*

This course guides someone with basic understanding of statistics through the same introduction to statistics as you took in undergrad, but this time using R (unless you also used R in undergrad, then it is exactly the same).

You will learn:
- The Central Limit Theorem
- Normal Distribution
- Hypothesis Testing
- Parametric vs. Non-parametric tests
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Some basic R syntax
